# Text-Classification-Using-Naive-Bayes

## ðŸ’¯ Motivation
While learning about NLP, specifically text classification, I followed Simplilearn's [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60pqgfT5tZM) regarding Text Classification Using Naive Bayes.   

Naive Bayes are mostly used in natural language processing (NLP) problems. Naive Bayes predicts the tag of a text. They calculate the probability of each tag for a given text and then output the tag with the highest one.


## ðŸ“š Application

Text classifiers can be used to organize, structure, and categorize pretty much any kind of text â€“ from documents, medical studies and files, and all over the web.
